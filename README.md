> ## Instructions
> 
> This task builds on Task 1, where you will now develop your CV page to include JavaScript and make it more dynamic.
> 
> You are only allowed to develop the page with pure JavaScript (i.e., Vanilla JavaScript).
> 
> ## What You Need to Do
> 
> Continue developing your CV page from Task 2 to meet the following requirements:
> 
> ### **CV in a file**
> 
> - Your education and previous workplaces should no longer be in the HTML code.
> - The education you’ve completed and jobs you’ve had should be stored in a separate JSON file.
> - This JSON file should be read to generate your CV.
> 
> ### **Interactive Scripts**
> 
> - Your CV page should contain at least one interactive JavaScript element that you have written yourself. Additionally, you should integrate at least one interactive function based on an existing pure JavaScript solution (not from a library).
>     - Examples of functions could include a modal, slideshow, scroll effects, or functions to hide/show elements.
>     - Be sure to comment on your code to clearly indicate which parts you wrote yourself and which are based on external sources. Also, provide the source for the external code.
>     - To find suitable scripts, you can explore resources like GitHub, CodePen, or MDN Web Docs, which offer many examples and snippets for inspiration or as a foundation for your projects.
> 
> ### **Portfolio**
> 
> - Include a section of your page showcasing the projects you’ve built.
> 
>**Extra Challenge**
> 
> These were previously VG requirements but are now optional. However, they provide an excellent challenge and preparation for the next course.
> 
> - Expand your portfolio to fetch public projects from your own GitHub via API. Display these projects in your portfolio with names and descriptions.
> - While fetching the projects, provide an indication that the projects are loading so the visitor doesn’t wonder why the page is initially empty.
> 
> ### **Technical Requirements**
> 
> - Validate with 0 errors on [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/).
> - No errors in the Console.
> - The website must be technically optimized for search engines, including proper use of semantic HTML5 elements, meta tags for title and description, and optimized images for fast load times.
