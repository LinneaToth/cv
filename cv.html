            <h3>Liro IT AB // Co-founder</h3>
            <p>My ongoing transition from architect to web developer is a pursuit of a nearly life-long dream of coding.
                My partner Robert and I co-founded LIRO IT AB a few years ago. While he, a seasoned computer engineer,
                has been focusing
                on consulting, my role involves expanding the
                company's scope with my experience and the skill set I am currently acquiring through my studies.

                projects, and
                participated in budget work and development projects. My role has often been leading, educational, and
                developmental.</p>
